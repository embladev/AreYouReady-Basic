Practical assessment for interns joining Embla

# Problem
We are in the process of building a project managment software and as the initial requirement we want the projects to be listed and filtered.

# Solution - step 1
* Analyse the above requirement and list down the acceptance criteria/test cases based on your assumptions
* Identify the object that will be used in your solution and justify the reasons for selecting these ( Not objects in libraries or programming language libraries ). 
* Create sequence diagram
* Create the class diagram* 
* Please attach the diagrams and other related text in the reply email 

# Solution - step 2
* List the projects on a html page. The project list is in a JSON file in this repo. 
* Technology to use
- Basic HTML, Javascript/Typescript

```sh
> No js frameworks to be used in this project
> No libraries should be used
> Only pure HTML and JS 
```

* Output - html and js files

# Solution - step 3
* Filter the project list. User type in the project name and the filtered projects will be listed

# Solution - step 4
Zip all the files and send it Embla HR. Please add installation instruction if any.
